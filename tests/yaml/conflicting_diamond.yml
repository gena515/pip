  # -- currently the error message is:
  # Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement D==2.0.0 (from c)
  # Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement D==1.0.0 (from b)
  # No matching distribution found for d, d
  # -- This is a bit confusing, as both versions of D are available.
  # -- better would be something like:
  # A 1.0.0 -> B 1.0.0 -> D 1.0.0
  # A 1.0.0 -> C 1.0.0 -> D 2.0.0
