``pip freeze``, ``pip list``, and ``pip show`` no longer normalize underscore
(``_``) in distribution names to dash (``-``). This is a side effect of the
migration to ``importlib.metadata``, since the underscore-dash normalization
behavior is non-standard and specific to setuptools. This should not affect
other parts of pip (for example, when feeding the ``pip freeze`` result back
into ``pip install``) since pip internally performs standard PEP 503
normalization independently to setuptools.
