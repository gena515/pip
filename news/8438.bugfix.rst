If the user's pip.conf includes a target directory setting,
attempting to install a package in editable mode or from source
results in a fatal error during the installation of setuptools.

The following assertion triggers:
assert not (home and prefix), "home={} prefix={}".format(home, prefix)

To avoid this issue when building a package, the target
setting should be ignored. This can be achieved by passing an empty
target when installing dependencies in the BuildEnvironment class.
