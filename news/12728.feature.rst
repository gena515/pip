``wheel`` is no longer explicitly listed as a build depepndency of ``pip``.
``setuptools`` already injects this dependency in the ``get_requires_for_build_wheel()`` hook.
This makes no difference for users of ``pip``.
This makes no difference when building wheels of ``pip``.
This avoids an unnecessary dependency on ``wheel`` when building the source distribution of ``pip``.
