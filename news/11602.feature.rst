Add support to use `build <https://pypi.org/project/build/>`_ as an alternative
isolated build environment implementation. The implementation can be enabled by
installing ``build`` into the environment, and adding the ``--use-feature=build``
flag to various pip commands.

``build`` is a light-weight build frontend for ``pyproject.toml`` projects,
providing various benefits by leveraging modern standards and tools. This
addition only enables pip to use its logic for environment creation and
populating build dependencies. Depending on feedback, pip may switch to also
run the build logic with ``build``, and switch the default build interface in
the future.
