Allow prioritizing package lookup according to their source.

When using ``--use-feature=source-priority``, ources now behave as fallback to
each other: if a candidate is found in a higher priority source, it will be
downloaded from that source even if a higher version of the package is found in
another source.

Sources are ordered from highest to lowest priority as:

* ``--find-links`` archives
* ``--find-links`` links
* links from PEP 503 indexes: base index (pypi.org or ``--index-url``) first,
  then other indexes in the order specified by ``--extra-index-url``
