Restore compatibility with legacy PyPy-specific interpreter wheel tags that use
the interpreter implementation version in the filename instead of the nominal
Python language version (for example, the expected PyPy-specific interpreter
tag is ``pp36`` for versions of PyPy that target Python 3.6 compatibility, but
older versions of pip instead looked for tags like ``pp372``, incorporating the
first two digits of the implementation version).
