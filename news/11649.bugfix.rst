Normalize extras according to :pep:`685` from package metadata in the resolver
for comparison. This ensures extras are correctly compared and merged as long
as the package providing the extra(s) is built with values normalized according
to the standard. Note, however, that this *does not* solve cases where the
package itself contains unnormalized extra values in the metadata.
