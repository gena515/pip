Add an ``always-install-via-wheel`` feature flag. When enabled, ``--no-binary``
no longer implies using the legacy ``setup.py install`` path, and instead
a wheel is built locally before installing. ``--build-option`` and
``--global-option`` are now passed to ``setup.py bdist_wheel`` in ``pip
install``, as it was already done in ``pip wheel``. ``--install-option`` is
ignored (because there is no ``setup.py install`` involved).
