The metadata-fetching log message is moved to the VERBOSE level and now hidden
by default. The more significant information in this message to most users are
already available in surrounding logs (the package name and version of the
metadata being fetched), while the URL to the exact metadata file is generally
too long and clutters the output. The message can be brought back with
``--verbose``.
