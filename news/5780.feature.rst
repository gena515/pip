Reinstallation and upgrade behaviour of direct URL requirements are completely
rewritten to better match user expectation. Now pip will try to parse the URLs
and VCS information (if applicable) from both the incoming direct URLs and the
already-installed PEP 610 metadata to determine whether reinstallation is
needed. If pip guesses wrong, the user can also force pip to always reinstall
direct URL requirments (but not version-specified ones) with ``--upgrade``.
