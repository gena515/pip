When pip is asked to uninstall a project without the dist-info/RECORD file
it will no longer traceback with FileNotFoundError,
but it will provide a better error message instead, such as::

    ERROR: Cannot uninstall foobar 0.1, RECORD file not found. You might be able to recover from this via: 'pip install --force-reinstall --no-deps foobar==0.1'.

When dist-info/INSTALLER is present and contains some useful information, the info is included in the error message instead::

    ERROR: Cannot uninstall foobar 0.1, RECORD file not found. Hint: The package was installed by rpm.
