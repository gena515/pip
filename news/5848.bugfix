Extract files from wheel archives in chunks, instead of decompressing the
entire file content into memory before writing it to disk. For the vast
majority of cases (PCs with ample RAM and/or small wheels) this makes no
difference. But there are some circumstances (e.g. a Raspberry Pi with no swap,
the default config, plus a wheel containing huge libraries like Tensorflow) in
which this leads to a failure to unpack and a crash with a MemoryError.
