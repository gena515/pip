.. _`Installation`:

Installation
============

Python Support
--------------

pip works with CPython versions 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 and also pypy.


Using virtualenv
----------------

The easiest way to install and use pip is with `virtualenv
<http://www.virtualenv.org>`_, since every virtualenv has pip (and it's dependencies) installed into it
automatically.

This does not require root access or modify your system Python
installation. For instance::

    $ virtualenv my_env
    $ . my_env/bin/activate
    (my_env)$ pip install SomePackage

When used in this manner, pip will only affect the active virtual environment.

See the `virtualenv installation instructions <http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/#installation>`_.

Installing Globally
-------------------

pip can be installed globally in order to manage global packages.
Often this requires the installation to be performed as root.

.. warning::

    We advise against using easy_install to install pip, because easy_install
    does not download it through SSL, so the installation might be insecure.
    Since pip can then be used to install packages (which execute code on
    your computer), it is better to go through a trusted path.

.. warning::

    pip versions before 1.3 do not use SSL for installing packages, and thus
    might be subject to attacks that can result in serious attacks on your
    computer (remote code execution). We advise to make sure you are installing
    at least pip 1.3.


Installing on Linux
+++++++++++++++++++

On Linux, pip is packaged by most distributions. For instance, on an Ubuntu
system, you can install it with::

    $ sudo apt-get install python-pip

On a Fedora system, you can install it with::

    $ yum install python-pip


Installing on other operating systems
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A global install of pip requires either `setuptools <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`_
or `distribute <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/distribute>`_ to be installed globally as well.

In many cases, these can be installed using your OS package manager.

See the `Distribute Install Instructions <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/distribute/>`_ or the
`Setuptools Install Instructions <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools#installation-instructions>`_

.. warning::

    If you are using Python 3.X you **must** use distribute; setuptools doesn't
    support Python 3.X.


After having installed the prerequisites, download `get-pip.py <https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py>`_
and execute it using Python::

 $ curl -O https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py
 $ [sudo] python get-pip.py

or alternatively, you can install the package from sources::

 $ curl -O https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/p/pip/pip-X.X.tar.gz
 $ tar xvfz pip-X.X.tar.gz
 $ cd pip-X.X
 $ [sudo] python setup.py install
