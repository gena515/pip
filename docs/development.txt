Pull Requests
=============

* Submit Pull Requests against the `develop` branch.
* Provide a good description of what your doing and why.
* Provide tests that cover your changes.
* Please try to run the tests locally first.
* All pull requests are tested using Travis upon submission.
* The only way to trigger Travis to run again, is to submit a change to the pull branch.


Running tests
=============

OS Requirements: subversion, bazaar, git, and mercurial.

Python Requirements: nose, virtualenv, scripttest, and mock

Ways to run the tests locally:

::

 $ python setup.py test  # Using the setuptools test plugin
 $ nosetests             # Using nosetests directly
 $ tox                   # Using tox against pip's tox.ini


Getting Involved
================

The pip project welcomes help in the following ways:

- Making Pull Requests for code, tests, or docs.
- Commenting on open issues and pull requests.
- Helping to answer questions on the mailing list.

If you want to become an official maintainer, start by helping out.
Later, when you think you're ready, get in touch with one of the maintainers,
and they will initiate a vote.
