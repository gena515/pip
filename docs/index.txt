pip
===

pip is a tool for installing and managing Python packages, such as those
found in the `Python Package Index <http://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_.

pip is a replacement for `easy_install
<http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall>`_.  It mostly
uses the same techniques for finding packages, so packages that are
easy_installable should be pip-installable as well.  This means that
you can use ``pip install SomePackage`` instead of ``easy_install
SomePackage``.

In order to use pip, you must first install `setuptools
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`_ or `distribute
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/distribute>`_.  If you use `virtualenv
<http://www.virtualenv.org>`_, a copy of pip will be automatically be
installed in each virtual environment you create.
