===============
Getting Started
===============

Weâ€™re pleased that you are interested in working on pip.

This document is meant to get you setup to work on pip and to act as a guide and
reference to the the development setup. If you face any issues during this
process, please `open an issue`_ about it on the issue tracker.

Running Developent Version
==========================

Clone git repository and change dir into it:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone https://github.com/pypa/pip
    $ cd pip

Then run `python src/pip`:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python src/pip
    
That's it!

You may want to skip to next chapter, or read on for full details.

Running `src/pip` will load all `pip` modules and
`dependencies <https://github.com/pypa/pip/tree/master/src/pip/_vendor)>`_
from the clone directory. This way they do not need to be installed on your
system. The process of bundling dependencies with a project sources is called
`vendoring`, but because there is no PEP for that, other Python won't work
this way and still require `pip` for installation.

If you want to practice `virtualenv` development, then `pip` inside can be
relinked directly to development sources by installing it in
`development mode`. `pip install -e .` does that. This needs to be done only
once.

Full setup for `virtualenv` in `devpip` subdir:

.. code-block:: console

    $ virtualenv .devpip
    $ source .devpip/bin/activate
    # ^^^ Linux only, on Windows run `.devpip/Scripts/activate.bat`
    (.devpip)$ pip install -e .

To avoid activating `virtualenv` every time to test `pip`, you can use full path
to the executable to run development version:

.. code-block:: console

    $ .devpip/bin/pip --version
    pip 18.1.dev0 from /home/techtonik/p/pip/src/pip (python 2.7)

    $ pip --version
    pip 9.0.1 from /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages (python 2.7)
    $ python src/pip --version
    pip 18.1.dev0 from /home/techtonik/p/pip/src/pip (python 2.7)

Development Tools
=================

pip uses :pypi:`tox` for testing against multiple different Python environments
and ensuring reproducible environments for linting and building documentation.

For developing pip, you need to install ``tox`` on your system. Often, you can
just do ``python -m pip install tox`` to install and use it.

Running Tests
-------------

pip uses the :pypi:`pytest` test framework, :pypi:`mock` and :pypi:`pretend`
for testing. These are automatically installed by tox for running the tests.

To run tests locally, run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ tox -e py36

The example above runs tests against Python 3.6. You can also use other
versions like ``py27`` and ``pypy3``.

``tox`` has been configured to any additional arguments it is given to
``pytest``. This enables the use of pytest's `rich CLI`_. As an example, you
can select tests using the various ways that pytest provides:

.. code-block:: console

    $ # Using file name
    $ tox -e py36 -- tests/functional/test_install.py
    $ # Using markers
    $ tox -e py36 -- -m unit
    $ # Using keywords
    $ tox -e py36 -- -k "install and not wheel"

Running pip's test suite requires supported version control tools (subversion,
bazaar, git, and mercurial) to be installed. If you are missing one of the VCS
tools, you can tell pip to skip those tests:

.. code-block:: console

    $ tox -e py36 -- -k "not svn"
    $ tox -e py36 -- -k "not (svn or git)"

Running Linters
---------------

pip uses :pypi:`flake8` and :pypi:`isort` for linting the codebase. These
ensure that the codebase is in compliance with :pep:`8` and the imports are
consistently ordered and styled.

To use linters locally, run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ tox -e lint-py2
    $ tox -e lint-py3

The above commands run the linters on Python 2 followed by Python 3.

.. note::

    Do not silence errors from flake8 with ``# noqa`` comments or otherwise.
    The only exception to this is silencing unused-import errors for imports
    related to static type checking as currently `flake8 does not understand
    PEP 484 type-comments`_.

Running mypy
------------

pip uses :pypi:`mypy` to run static type analysis, which helps catch certain
kinds of bugs. The codebase uses `PEP 484 type-comments`_ due to compatibility
requirements with Python 2.7.

To run the ``mypy`` type checker, run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ tox -e mypy

Building Documentation
----------------------

pip's documentation is built using :pypi:`Sphinx`. The documentation is written
in reStructuredText.

To build it locally, run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ tox -e docs

The built documentation can be found in the ``docs/build`` folder.
