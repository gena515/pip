Weâ€™re pleased that you are interested in triaging. Triaging is the process of reviewing bugs 
to ensure they are valid, reproducible, and have accurate information that allows them to be 
resolved and tested.  After a bug is triaged, it should be sequenced according to the 
priority for fixing it. 

For more information please take a look at the following.
