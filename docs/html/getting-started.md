# Getting Started

To get started with using pip, you should install Python on your system.

## Checking if you have a working pip

The best way to check if you have a working pip installation is to run:

```{pip-cli}
$ pip --version
pip X.Y.Z from ... (python X.Y)
```

If that worked, congratulations! You have a working pip in your environment.

If you got output that does not look like the sample above, read on -- the rest
of this page has information about how to install pip within a Python
environment that doesn't have it.

## Next Steps

As a next step, you'll want to read the
["Installing Packages"](pypug:tutorials/installing-packages) tutorial on
packaging.python.org. That tutorial will guide you through the basics of using
pip for installing packages.
