# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The pip team applies security fixes to the latest version of pip [available on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)
and doesn't backport security fixes to previous versions.

The pip team doesn't apply security fixes to pip distributions maintained by third-party redistributors.
Please contact your corresponding distribution security team for more information.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please read the guidelines on reporting security issues [on the
official website](https://www.python.org/dev/security/) for
instructions on how to report a security-related problem to
the Python Security Response Team responsibly.

To reach the response team, email `security at python dot org`.
